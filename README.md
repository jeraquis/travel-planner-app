The app returns weather info for any requests in the next 16 days.

The app treats locations differently, depending on the country.

If the location is out of the country, the app returns information about the country, as well as an image of its flag, even if weather info is not available.

Data is cleared if a subsequent search does not use the same fields. For example, if a person searches for a foreign destination and later searches for one within the US, the country info is cleared.

The app searches Pixabay for a picture of the city. If that doesn't return anything, it retrieves a picture of the country (if foreign) or the state (if in the US).
